Since I am still attending university, the highlights of my CV are mainly focused on my education.

<br><br>

After finishing high school, I attended the University of Leuven, Belgium's biggest uni. After five years of study, I left Leuven in 2014 with a <u>BSc and a MSC in Engineering</u>, both with computer science as the main subject.

<br><br>

While I had some opportunities to focus on computer graphics in Leuven, the course I followed was a general computer science course. I felt like I needed more knowledge about CGI and animation in order to follow my dream of going into the animation industry. That's why I ended up doing the <u>MSc in Computer Animation & Visual Effects at the NCCA</u>, a part of Bournemouth University. I expect to graduate from this course in September 2015.

<br><br>

While I haven't had a full-time job yet, I have done <u>several programming summer jobs</u>. In 2012, I programmed C++ for the robotics research group of Leuven University. The year after that I did an unpaid internship at AGFA Graphics NV, programming in C++ once again. In the summer of 2014, I was rehired by AGFA to extend on the work I did the year before.

<br><br>

For a thorough overview, I refer to the pdf containing my actual CV.
